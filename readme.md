# User Roles and Permissions

## Why are we doing this?
We found a gap in rails engines / gems for roles management.

## What are our observations
1. Unable to assign permissions to resources based on roles 
2. Unable to create user groups for easy role management
3. Unable to assign managers to users
4. Unable to request manager permission to perform operations
